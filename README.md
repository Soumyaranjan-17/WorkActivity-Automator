# 🚀 WorkActivity Automator

> Simulate human-like activity in VS Code & Chrome to keep sessions active, prevent idle timeouts, or for demos & testing.

---

## ✨ Features
- ⚙️ **Configurable Automation**: Enable/disable activity simulation for VS Code and Chrome independently.
- 🤖 **Human-like Randomization**: Wait times and key presses are randomized within user-defined ranges to mimic natural behavior.
- 🗂️ **Multi-Tab Chrome Support**: Simulates activity across multiple Chrome tabs, including scrolling and tab switching.
- 🛠️ **Easy Customization**: All key parameters (delays, durations, press counts) are set at the top of the script for quick adjustment.
- 🛑 **Graceful Exit**: Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the simulation at any time.
- 🖥️ **Clear Console Output**: Real-time feedback on actions being performed.
- 🔁 **Session Loop**: Repeats the process in rounds until interrupted, for continuous simulation.

## 🧰 Requirements
- 🐍 Python 3.x
- [pynput](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/) library

### 📦 Install dependencies
```sh
pip install pynput
```

## 🚦 Usage
1. 🖥️ **Prepare Your Workspace**: Open both Visual Studio Code and Google Chrome. Arrange them so that `Alt+Tab` switches between them easily.
2. ⚙️ **Configure Settings**: Edit the variables at the top of `WorkActivity_Automator.py` to suit your needs (e.g., enable/disable Chrome or VS Code automation, adjust timings, session durations, etc.).
3. ▶️ **Run the Script**:
   ```sh
   python WorkActivity_Automator.py
   ```
4. 👀 **Observe Automation**: The script will begin after an initial delay, then alternate between VS Code and Chrome (if enabled), simulating scrolling and tab switching.
5. ✋ **Stop Anytime**: Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to exit.

## 🛠️ Key Settings
- `enable_vscode`, `enable_chrome`: Toggle automation for each app.
- `initial_delay`: Wait time before automation starts.
- `vscode_session_duration`: Total time spent in VS Code per round.
- `chrome_tab_time_total`: Time per Chrome tab.
- `chrome_tab_min`, `chrome_tab_max`: Number of Chrome tabs per round.
- `*_press_min`, `*_press_max`: Number of down arrow presses per scroll event.
- `*_wait_min`, `*_wait_max`: Wait time between scroll events.
- `key_press_interval`: Interval between individual key presses.

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works
- 📝 **VS Code**: Simulates random down arrow key presses at intervals, mimicking scrolling through code.
- 🌐 **Chrome**: For each tab, simulates scrolling, then switches to the next tab using `Ctrl+Tab`.
- 🔄 **Window Switching**: Uses `Alt+Tab` to alternate between VS Code and Chrome.
- 🔁 **Session Loop**: Repeats the process in rounds until interrupted.

## 💡 Tips
- 🪟 For best results, ensure Chrome and VS Code are the only windows in the Alt+Tab cycle.
- 🧩 You can further customize the script to add more actions or support other applications.
- ⏱️ Test with short durations and intervals before using longer sessions.
- 🖥️ Run the script in a dedicated workspace to avoid interfering with other applications.
